    - show a default set of routes

  http://mbtaplot.appspot.com/?routes=77,78,72
    - show specific routes

  http://mbtaplot.appspot.com/?routes=all
    - show all routes
     - very slow, may crash your browser

  http://mbtaplot.appspot.com/?routes=77,78,72&shading=true
    - shade and size routes by the number of buses currently on them
    - ideally we'd merge sections over the same area so we could size
      them properly, but we don't
      - the shared portions of routes will be underemphasized
  
  click on a route to show the buses on it

  click on it again (at least 45sec later) to update bus locations
